### Access and Licensing

To access the full range of test-related features, users must have Basic + Test Plans access level or subscribe to one of the following plans:

|Subscription|Features Accessible for No Extra Charge|

|Visual Studio Enterprise|All Test Plans features|
|Visual Studio Test Professional|All Test Plans features|

Nonsubscribers need to purchase Basic + Test Plans licenses. It is important to note that manual testers can execute tests with Basic access, and licenses for this extension also provide rights to use Microsoft Test Manager (a deprecated on-premises client).

### Permissions

In addition to the access level, users need specific permissions for certain tasks. Manual testing, managed through test-specific work item types, follows permissions similar to work item management.

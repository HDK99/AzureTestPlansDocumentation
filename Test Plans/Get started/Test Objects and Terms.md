| Test **plans**    | Are used to group test suites and individual test cases. To define a test plan, see [[Azure DevOps/Test Plans/Get Started/Create Test Plans and Test Suites\|Create Test Plans and Test Suites]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Test **suite**    | Group test cases into separate testing scenarios within a single test plan. Grouping test cases makes it easier to see which scenarios are complete. When creating a test suite, you can specify one of three types:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Test **cases**    | Define steps to test code or an app for deployment. Ensure code works correctly, is error-free, and meets business and customer requirements. Test cases can be added to a test plan individually without creating a test suite. Multiple test suites or plans can refer to a single test case. Two types of test cases are:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Shared steps      | Use to share steps between multiple test cases. For example, log-in and verify steps for signing into an application are steps that can be shared across a number of test cases.
